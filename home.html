    <h1>Vex Robotics</h1>
    <p> is a group which designs and builds Vex robots to take part in competitions during the year.
     In the qualifying matches at each event (scrimmage) held during the year, the teams are paired randomly and 
     the pair competes against another pair to manipulate objects and place them in scoring zones to gain points.
     The top teams from the qualifiers then select partners to 
     compete in the finals. Each year the game changes with different game pieces and scoring objectives
     This is a worldwide competition with a National NZ 
     competition in February and World Championships in the USA in April.
     There are two groups – Vex IQ for Year 7 & 8 and Vex VRC for Year 9-13.
     The kiwibots (the NZ Vex organisation) has lots of good links. There are also online competitions.</p>
