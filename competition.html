     <h1>The Game:</h1>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">
          VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back is
          played on a 12’ x 12’ square field configured as seen above. 
          Two (2) Alliances – one (1) “red” and one (1) “blue” – composed of two (2) Teams each,
          compete in matches consisting of a fifteen (15) second Autonomous Period,
          followed by a one minute and forty-five second (1:45) Driver Controlled Period.
          The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Blocks in Goals, Controlling zones within Goals, and Parking
          in defined zones at the end of the Match</p>

     <h1>The Competition:</h1>
     <p style="font-size:20px;"> Competition Brings STEM Skills to Life
            All students are natural scientists and engineers. They love to question, tinker, experiment and play.
             VEX competitions foster these skills and capitalize on the motivational effects of competitions and robotics to help all students create
              an identity as a STEM learner. VEX competitions are also a great way to expose students to valuable soft skills like communication, collaboration
               and time-management in a fun and authentic way. The VEX Robotics competition prepares students to become future innovators with 95% of
                participants reporting an increased interest in STEM subject areas and pursuing STEM-related careers. 
            Tournaments are held year-round at the regional, state, and national levels and culminate at the VEX Robotics World Championship each April!</p>
